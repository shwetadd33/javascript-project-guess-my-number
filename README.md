# Number Guessing Game

## Description
A simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player, indicating if their guess is too high or too low, and counts the number of guesses.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML & CSS
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript

## Approach
1. **Generate Random Number**: Generate a random number between 1 and 20 using `Math.random()`.
2. **User Input Handling**: Allow the user to input their guess through a text field and submit it by clicking a button.
3. **Compare Guess**: Compare the user’s guess with the generated number to check if it’s correct, higher, or lower.
4. **Feedback via Alerts**: Provide appropriate feedback through alerts based on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
5. **Increment Guess Counter**: Count and increment the number of guesses after each incorrect attempt.
